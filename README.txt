Use the image “women” from “Samples” of the class website: http://imaging.utk.edu/IP. Implement a general 3x3 spatial filter mask: (w1, w2, ..., w9). Read w1 through w9 from a file.Test your code using carefully chosen w’s. Implement the following filters:F = 1/9 (1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1)F = 1/16 (1,2,1,2,4,2,1,2,1)F = (0,1,0,1,-4,1,01,0)F = (1,1,1,1,-8,1,1,1,1)F = (0,-1,0,-1,4,-1,0,-1,0)F = (-1,-2,-1,0,0,0,1,2,1)F = (-1,0,1,-2,0,2,-1,0,1)F = (-1,-1,-1,-1,A+8,-1,-1,-1,-1); use various values of A to analyze/interpret its effect.Compare the speeds of implementing the gradient using (a) square roots and (b) absolute values. Give specific image size, processor specs, and runtimes.Implement a 3x3 median filter. Use the corresponding image in the book to show the filtering effect.Compile report.
